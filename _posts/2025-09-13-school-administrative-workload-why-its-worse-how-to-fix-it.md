title: School Administrative Workload: Why It's Worse & How to Fix It
---

[Brian McManus][1]{: rel="noreferrer"} - September 14, 2025

Imagine an assistant principal arriving at school before sunrise. Before
the first bell rings, they\'ve already managed three parent emails,
found coverage for a sick teacher, reviewed disciplinary reports from
the previous day, and mediated a conflict between two staff members.
This feeling of being trapped in a cycle of reactive management is a
universal experience, and the data confirms it: a majority of school
leaders report spending **more than six hours a week on administrative
paperwork** (NASSP). This constant pressure isn\'t just about managing
tasks; it\'s taking a profound human toll. A staggering **three-quarters
of school leaders (73%) report they needed help with their mental or
emotional health last year** (NASSP+2). This isn\'t a personal time
management issue; it is the direct result of a systemic evolution of the
role over the past two decades, driven by policy shifts and societal
pressures. This article will validate that experience by tracing the
historical roots of the modern administrative workload, using research
to show how the job has fundamentally changed and setting the stage for
a new way of thinking about the role.

For 15 of my 20 years in education, I would roll my eyes internally
whenever a seasoned educator complained about the workload \"back in the
day.\" When I started teaching English at a large high school, No Child
Left Behind was the only reality I knew, and from my vantage point, its
impact was minimal. My eye-roll was due to ignorance. It wasn\'t until I
moved into administration that the work became Sisyphian. The daily
cycle of observation reports, board communications, substitute
coordination, and lunch duty felt like pushing a heavy boulder up a
mountain, only to watch it roll back down each morning. The \"other
stuff\" started to define my role; instead of being in classrooms or
meeting with knuckleheaded teenagers who made poor choices, I spent more
time in my office pushing that boulder. Were the old-timers correct? Do
my eyes owe them an apology?

The intensification of the school administrator\'s workload is not
merely a perception but a well-documented phenomenon in educational
research. Foundational reports have established that **school
leadership** is second only to classroom instruction in its impact on
student outcomes, highlighting the critical nature of the principal\'s
role (Leithwood et al., 2004). However, the capacity to perform the
high-impact functions of this role has been progressively eroded. The
shift began in earnest with federal accountability mandates that
fundamentally altered the job\'s focus, burying leaders in bureaucratic
tasks that divert their attention from the core mission of supporting
teaching and learning (Horng et al., 2010).

## From Instructional Leader to Chief Problem-Solver: A 20-Year Shift   {#from-instructional-leader-to-chief-problem-solver-a-20-year-shift}

The role of a school administrator has morphed from a primary focus on
curriculum and instruction to a complex, multi-faceted position centered
on compliance, crisis management, and public relations. This shift in
**school leadership** over the past 20 years has left many principals
and assistant principals feeling like they are responding to an endless
series of urgent problems rather than proactively shaping the
**educational leadership** and culture of their schools. Research
clearly shows that this transformation is a direct consequence of
escalating external pressures, from federal policy to community
politics, which have redefined the core responsibilities of the job.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card" markdown="1">

This isn\'t just about policy; consider the role technology now plays in
our schools. It has become intertwined with every curricular decision,
and it’s expensive and messy. Acceptable Use Policies, proxy servers,
inventory, maintenance, and connectivity are all burdens on
administrators.

### The Principalship in the Pre-Accountability Era: A Different Focus   {#the-principalship-in-the-pre-accountability-era-a-different-focus}

Two decades ago, the principal was largely seen as the head of the
school building, a role centered on operational management, staff
oversight, and fostering a positive school climate. The primary focus
was on creating an orderly environment conducive to learning, with
instructional leadership often taking the form of periodic teacher
evaluations and curriculum oversight. While demanding, the role was more
circumscribed, with fewer external mandates dictating the day-to-day
allocation of a principal\'s time and energy (Darling-Hammond, 2007).

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card" markdown="1">

</figure>

Finding a balance between leadership and management today is challenging
when the managerial aspects are often the key deliverables for a school
district. Generating reports for the central office, managing
ever-shrinking budgets, and navigating new cultural mandates—all of
these pressures have an impact on school leaders that flows down to
teachers and, ultimately, to students. An assistant principal who spends
every morning cursing the substitute coverage crisis is not in the
optimal mindset to be an instructional leader. That stress has an
impact.

### How Policy and Technology Increased Mandates Without Increasing Hours   {#how-policy-and-technology-increased-mandates-without-increasing-hours}

The most significant driver of change was the accountability movement,
beginning with the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in 2001 and
continuing with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. These
federal laws tied school funding and evaluations to standardized test
scores, compelling administrators to become data analysts and compliance
managers (Darling-Hammond, 2007). The rise of technology, while offering
tools for efficiency, also created an expectation of constant
availability and instantaneous reporting, adding to the pressure without
adding hours to the day. This policy-driven shift dramatically increased
the volume of \"bureaucratic\" **administrative tasks**, pulling
principals away from classrooms and into offices to manage paperwork and
reporting requirements (Horng et al., 2010).

> This has led to a \"compliance-oriented culture\" where the focus can
> shift from holistic student development to narrowly defined,
> test-based outcomes (Au, 2011).
{: .kg-blockquote-alt}

### The Data Dilemma: How the Push for Student Achievement Metrics Bloated Administrative Tasks   {#the-data-dilemma-how-the-push-for-student-achievement-metrics-bloated-administrative-tasks}

The emphasis on **student achievement** metrics, while intended to
promote equity, created an enormous administrative burden. School
leaders now coordinate extensive testing schedules, analyze vast amounts
of performance data, and develop detailed improvement plans. This has
led to a \"compliance-oriented culture\" where the focus can shift from
holistic student development to narrowly defined, test-based outcomes
(Au, 2011). Consequently, principals spend significant time in data
meetings and completing reports, which directly trades off with time
that could be spent on instructional coaching and teacher development
(Grissom et al., 2013).

Perhaps the worst part of the accountability movement has been the
proliferation of online, adaptive learning platforms that collect every
conceivable data point. Programs like i-Ready, IXL, and Aleks provide
hundreds of metrics, and frankly, it\'s too many. Which of these data
points truly impacts student learning? I can\'t say for sure, but I also
can\'t begin to estimate the hours I\'ve spent in data analysis meetings
trying to find out. I am not suggesting student data shouldn\'t be
analyzed. But the sheer volume of it, and the time it takes to make
sense of it, is a monumental time drain for both teachers and
administrators.

## What Is the True Cost of the Modern Administrative Workload?   {#what-is-the-true-cost-of-the-modern-administrative-workload}

The true cost of the bloated **administrative workload schools** face is
measured in lost instructional time, diminished leader effectiveness,
and ultimately, a negative impact on the school community. When
administrators are mired in operational minutiae, they cannot focus on
the activities proven to drive school improvement. The **cost of manual
substitute teacher scheduling**, for instance, is not just a line item
in a budget; it represents hours of lost leadership capacity every
single day.

### Answering the Question: What is the cost of administrator time on substitute coverage?   {#answering-the-question-what-is-the-cost-of-administrator-time-on-substitute-coverage}

The persistent substitute teacher shortage has turned daily staffing
into a crisis. This task is no longer a simple clerical duty but a
time-consuming daily scramble that involves personally calling potential
subs, rearranging schedules, or even covering classrooms (Gewertz,
2023). Calculating the true cost requires factoring in the
administrator\'s salary for hours spent on this low-leverage task, the
opportunity cost of lost instructional leadership during that time, and
the risk of **principal burnout** as leaders are pulled from their core
duties to fill gaps.

### The Black Hole of Manual Processes: A Deep Dive into Substitute Teacher Scheduling   {#the-black-hole-of-manual-processes-a-deep-dive-into-substitute-teacher-scheduling}

**Why is substitute teacher scheduling so difficult?** The difficulty
arises from a shrinking pool of substitutes, a lack of integrated
technology, and the unpredictability of absences. The infamous **Friday
substitute teacher rush** is a real phenomenon, as absences often spike
at the end of the week. This manual process forces administrators into a
reactive mode, consuming critical morning hours that effective
principals would otherwise dedicate to instructional leadership
activities like classroom walkthroughs (Horng et al., 2010).

### The Impact on What Matters Most: Instructional Leadership and Burnout   {#the-impact-on-what-matters-most-instructional-leadership-and-burnout}

The relentless expansion of administrative duties has a direct and
damaging impact on instructional leadership and the well-being of school
leaders. As the scales tip toward managerial tasks, the time available
for high-impact activities like **teacher observation** shrinks, and the
risk of **principal burnout** skyrockets. This creates a vicious cycle
where stressed leaders are less effective at supporting their teachers,
which in turn can negatively affect student learning.

### The Core Conflict: What is the difference between a manager and an instructional leader?   {#the-core-conflict-what-is-the-difference-between-a-manager-and-an-instructional-leader}

A manager focuses on operations—budgets, schedules, compliance. An
instructional leader focuses on the core technology of schooling:
teaching and learning. Research makes a clear distinction; effective
principals engage in classroom observations, provide substantive
feedback, and foster professional collaboration (Grissom et al., 2013).
The modern workload forces administrators into a managerial posture,
fundamentally conflicting with the instructional leadership behaviors
known to improve **student achievement** (Horng et al., 2010).

My ideal day as an assistant principal was simple: welcome students,
visit classrooms, conduct observations, have professional conversations
with teachers, and make positive phone calls home for students who had a
great day. My typical day, however, left little time for any of that. My
time was focused on putting out fires, not being an instructional
leader.

### The Impact on Assistant Principal Instructional Leadership and Meaningful Feedback   {#the-impact-on-assistant-principal-instructional-leadership-and-meaningful-feedback}

With calendars packed, deep, meaningful **teacher observation** cycles
are often replaced by brief, superficial \"check-ins.\" The time needed
for substantive pre- and post-observation coaching is a luxury many
administrators can no longer afford. This erosion is a critical loss, as
a principal\'s ability to provide high-quality feedback is a key driver
of school improvement (Grissom et al., 2013). When an assistant
principal\'s day is consumed by discipline and operations, their
capacity for **assistant principal instructional leadership** is
severely compromised.

### The Unseen Toll: Connecting the Dots Between an Overwhelming Workload and Principal Burnout   {#the-unseen-toll-connecting-the-dots-between-an-overwhelming-workload-and-principal-burnout}

The combination of an intensified workload, expanded SEL
responsibilities, and heightened political pressures has led to a crisis
of **principal burnout**. Administrators are increasingly caught in the
crossfire of contentious community debates, adding significant emotional
labor to the job (Force, 2022). This unsustainable pressure contributes
to high turnover rates in school leadership, which destabilizes entire
school communities (Fullan &amp; Quinn, 2021).

There were nights I couldn\'t sleep because I knew the next day\'s sub
schedule was going to be like putting together a 1,000-piece jigsaw
puzzle of a black sky. I\'d walk into school with a metallic taste in my
mouth, using language that I was thankful my office door muffled. It
deeply impacted my mental health. I didn\'t want to be a substitute
scheduler; I wanted to be an assistant principal who worked with
teachers on their craft and helped students learn to engage with
society. Instead, I became a big ball of anxiety, which didn\'t help
anyone.

### A Systemic Problem Demands a Systemic Solution: How Schools Can Reduce the Administrative Workload   {#a-systemic-problem-demands-a-systemic-solution-how-schools-can-reduce-the-administrative-workload}

The question of **how can schools reduce administrative workload**
cannot be answered with simple tips for better **time management**. The
issue is not one of individual efficiency but of systemic overload. To
truly **reduce administrative workload for assistant principals** and
principals, schools must move beyond platitudes and implement systemic
solutions that reclaim time for instructional leadership.

To effectively **reduce the administrative workload for assistant
principals**, schools need systemic solutions, not just better **time
management**. This approach is crucial for preventing **principal
burnout** and creating space for effective **school leadership**. The
key is to leverage **administrative process automation for schools**,
such as **substitute management software**, to handle repetitive
**administrative tasks**. Automating daily **substitute teacher
scheduling**, for instance, frees leaders to focus on high-impact
**assistant principal instructional leadership** strategies that
directly improve **student achievement**.

## Moving Beyond \"Work Smarter, Not Harder   {#moving-beyond-work-smarter-not-harder}

For two decades, school administrators have been told to \"work smarter,
not harder,\" a phrase that ignores their ever-expanding job
descriptions. The problem is not a lack of effort but a lack of hours.
The literature shows that the overload is well-documented, but there is
a significant gap in research that tests scalable solutions (Spillane,
2005). True solutions must acknowledge the systemic nature of the
problem and focus on changing the system itself, not just asking
individuals to manage an unmanageable workload more efficiently.

### Leveraging Systems and Technology to Automate the Automatable   {#leveraging-systems-and-technology-to-automate-the-automatable}

<b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pro Tip from the Author
</strong></b>"Before investing in any new technology, conduct a 'time
audit' for one week. Log every non-instructional task that takes more
than 15 minutes. This data will pinpoint your biggest time sinks—like
substitute scheduling or parent communications—and show you exactly
where automation will have the greatest impact on reclaiming your day."
</div>
</div>

A key strategy for systemic change is the intelligent use of systems and
technology to automate or delegate non-instructional tasks. This could
involve adopting distributed leadership models, where responsibilities
are shared among a team (Spillane, 2005). Furthermore, schools can
leverage modern software to handle tasks like substitute management and
parent communication. Wrestling with antiquated or non-existent
**substitute management software** is a prime cause of the daily
scramble that can be automated away. By strategically automating routine
operational duties, districts can buffer principals from the
bureaucratic tasks that consume their days and allow them to focus on
the instructional leadership that improves teaching and learning (Horng
et al., 2010).

### **Conclusion**   {#conclusion}

#### **Key Takeaways:**   {#key-takeaways}

* The administrative burden on principals and assistant principals is
  not a personal failing but the result of a 20-year systemic shift
  driven by accountability mandates and expanding societal expectations.
* Manual, time-consuming processes, such as daily **substitute teacher
  scheduling**, directly erode the time and energy available for
  high-impact **assistant principal instructional leadership**.
* The solution to this crisis lies not in asking leaders to manage an
  impossible to-do list more efficiently, but in fundamentally
  redesigning school operations with systems and technology to protect
  the role of the instructional leader.

### About the Author:   {#about-the-author}

[Brian McManus][1]{: rel="noreferrer"} is an educational leader with
over 20 years of experience in public schools, including six years as a
high school Assistant Principal. After spending more than a decade
witnessing firsthand how systemic pressures and manual processes were
pulling school leaders out of classrooms and away from instructional
leadership, he dedicated himself to finding a better way. Frustrated by
the daily scramble of substitute scheduling and bureaucratic overload
that defined his role, he founded Lucid North and developed [Harry Llama
- The Intelligent Scheduler][4]{: rel="noreferrer"}. The firm focuses on
developing systems and strategies that empower administrators to
automate low-impact work, reduce burnout, and reclaim their time for
what matters most: improving teaching and learning.
